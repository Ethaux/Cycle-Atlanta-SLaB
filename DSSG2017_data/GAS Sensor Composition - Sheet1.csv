,* Findings from try-and-error testing,,,,,,,,,,
,1. SO2 sensor stopped working when exceeding 530K OHM --> we're using all the amplifying resistors with 470 K (instead of 560K),,,,,,,,,,
,"2. Some ADCs are not working for some address settings (e.g., #5 didn't work for 0x4A and 0X4B)",,,,,,,,,,
,"3. 5V was better than 3.3 V not only in the resolution of signals, but also in terms of sensor stability --> we're changing power sources to 5V for gas sensors.",,,,,,,,,,
,"4. There are a few, random sensor/amplifier flaws. ",,,,,,,,,,
