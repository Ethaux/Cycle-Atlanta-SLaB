Data Visualization using [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/)
=========
Visualization of the data is performed in a 3D environment supported by Rhinoceros and its addon Grasshopper for procedural and generative design. Rhinoceros is a broadly software used for 3D modelling and design with a high capacity of reading many different kind of files. Its power has been increased in the last years by the development of Grasshopper as a free addon for the software which allows to generate geometric and spatial feature from data.

Requirements for running viz routine:

 - Install Rhino 5
 - Install Grasshopper for Rhino
 - Install following libraries from Food4Rhino (list libraries)markdown
