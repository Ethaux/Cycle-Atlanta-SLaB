Cycle Atlanta: Seeing Like a Bike
================
[Civic Data Science at Georgia Tech]()http://civicdatascience.gatech.edu/2018/06/01/seeing-like-a-bike-2/
----------

The Cycle Atlanta project aims to create sensor systems that allow a bike to "see" its environment and collect data as a participatory effort to help the City of Atlanta make informed decisions about biking infrastructures. In Summer 2018, the Civic Data Science summer program focused especially on the challenges of collecting high quality pollution data from a mobile platform such as a bike. We focused mainly on evaluating the performance of low-cost air quality sensors, specifically the PMS5003, and comparing the results with a high quality sensor, the GRIMM Portable Aerosol Spectrometer.
