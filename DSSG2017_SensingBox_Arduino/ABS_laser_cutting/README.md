# ABS laser cutting

The files in this folder have no border. They are intended for being used directly for laser-cutting the ABS boxes. The box should be placed on the laser cutter bed with the face to be cut facing up, and with the opening facing right. The location of the box should be always on the top leftmost corner of the laser cutter. The file is set for being using the setting of 12 x 18 inches paper on the printer dialog from Illustrator. For getting the versions with the edges used for wooden cut, they are available in the folder “old”. The parameters of the cutting and engraving can change as the laser cutter has some sort of inconsistent behaviour. As general approach, for ABS, it is better several (around 10) quick passes which rather than a slow and powerful laser which can melt and damage the box. Engraving is only necessary in the front part. A test file is provided for checking different patterns on the ABS.
